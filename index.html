On behalf of the company, I would like to express my gratitude for your interest in joining us and welcome you for WDI - Machine Test Day.

Your first challenge is to complete a sample task assigned via our project management system called Asana.

The script and HTML file can be shared via https://gist.github.com/  while the URL must be posted within your Asana task as a comment. 

Although completing that task is important, seeing well structured and documented code is of a higher value, therefore, use some abracadabra powers to reflect this in your work. The architecture is also of importance, so it is easy to maintain and scale.

The deadline for this sample is 28- Aug-18,  6 pm IST

Please feel free to contact me if there is anything unclear.

P.S: Needs to be done alone, no outside help! May the force be with you.
